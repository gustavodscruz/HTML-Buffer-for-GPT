The news was shared on



 



the Government of Canada's social media channels



<span></span>



(@canadabra), making it clear that the Visa Application Centres (VACs) in São Paulo and Recife will reopen with limited
services starting December 14, 2020. Biometrics are included among these services. So, if you have already been
requested to provide biometrics, you can now schedule appointments at these locations.



 



 



 



The Canadian government also announced that the VACs in Brasília, Porto Alegre, and Rio de Janeiro are expected to
reopen in early January under similar conditions.

It's worth noting that, since



<span></span>



October 20



 



, foreign nationals with an approved



 



study permit have been



<span></span>



authorized to travel to Canada.

Students just need to ensure



 



 



that their chosen school/college/university has its COVID-19 readiness plan approved by the Canadian government in order
to receive them.
